This API uses [passportjs](http://www.passportjs.org/) for Authentication.
Current implementation works with JWT Tokens. Will be extended later to also include Google Login.

To run the tests, type npm test.

To start the server, type npm start.
Beware though, currently, start script is setup to
migrate to latest changes and restore all default
DB values on start. You might want to change those in production.

You need to have a .env file for environemental settings.
Currently, there are three keys you need to be set:
HOST
PORT
SECRET

For retrieving settings from .env, dotenv is used.

Testing libary used is: Mochajs with Chai.
